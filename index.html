        <p class="lead mb-5">Hello! My name is Justine Murphy. 
I would like to start off by saying that I have always had a passion for people and teeth. When I was 13, I got my braces off, and on that day I had a new perspective on teeth. I had no idea having nice, straight white teeth would give me so much confidence and self-worth. I want a helping hand in giving people confidence. Other than teeth, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, being outdoors, staying healthy, and helping people. I have had many different jobs ranging from lifeguard to office manager at an auto body shop, but none of then felt quite right. In 2015, I decided to return to school and become a registered dental hygienist.

Core competencies are something that strengthens over time, and when practiced will help make a better living environment. Applying a code of ethics will help individuals see the difference from right and wrong. Critical thinking is essential in assisting in diagnosing patients and coming up with a differential diagnosis. As a health care professional, promoting value and assuring quality is imperative. Patient need to know the importance in oral health and how it can cause systemic effects. Some of these systemic effects can flare up in the dental office. As a health care professional, it should be second nature to know how to handle a medical emergency and be familiar with the proper protocol.  <br>

The standard of care for a patient involves critical thinking about the patient’s overall health and well-being. It is vital to understand and be familiar with the dental considerations with medications and systemic diseases. Some of these disease may be diagnosed in the dental chair, and some of them may be exacerbated in the dental chair, which ever the case, dental professionals should be aware of the possibilities.  <br>
